This repository demonstrates a subtle runtime error that can occur in Scala when comparing objects of different types within a generic class. The `compare` method in `MyClass` attempts to directly compare `value` with `other.value` using `<`, which may not be defined for all type combinations of T and U.  The solution showcases a more robust approach using Ordering or type-specific comparison logic.
